# recursive_power_function
A recursive implementation to calculate mathematical power operations.

A power function is simply a repeated series of multiplications. Knowing this, a power can be calculated using recursion.
For example, 2^4 = 2*2*2*2

- The program prompts the user to enter the base and exponent for the power computation. 
- The pow() is called recursively to repeat the sub-multiplications to find the total value of the power function.
- Negative powers are also supported.
